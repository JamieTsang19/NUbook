Servos are electrical components that allow for the precise control and positioning of the various limbs attached to the NUgus robot. Usually, when a servo is found to not be performing correctly (i.e. seizing or a crunching sound can be heard), it is required to be removed and replaced with a new servo. 

Before a servo is first used, it\'s default parameters need to be updated to ensure correct operation of the limbs. This is done using the Dynamixel Wizard found at:

To setup or calibrate the servos please follow the following instructions:

1. Connect the servo to the power supply and dynamixel programming tool to your PC via the USB connection as shown TODO Insert Picture

2. Open Dynamixel Wizard

3. In the options menu, set the baudrate to the baudrate of the servo

   - 1000000 bps (Calibration)
   - 57600 bps (Setup)
   - TODO Insert Picture

4. Select the COM Port that the dynamixel tool is connected to, if unknown Select All.

5. Start the scan

6. TODO Need a servo to see what happens

7. The current servo position is shown on the servo by the dot on the driveshaft.
   Move the servo to the first position (straight up)
   Click confirm
   Follow the instructions on the screen for all 4 positions
   Test the calibration by setting the goal position to either side of the zero position (does the servo rotate all the way around)
   Check that the servo positions is approximately the target postion at a few different points.
   Check that the baud rate is still at (what the rate is)
   Check that the servo ID is set correctly (link to list of servo IDs and positions)
