It is important to write automated tests when working on a module or piece of code in the NUbots system <cite>doe,everton2020</cite>. Testing is not just an abstract "best practice" with no practical benefits, and it's not a waste of time <cite>everton2020</cite>. In fact, it'll actually save you and the other members of the team a lot of time going forward.

The tests you write <cite>smith</cite> will serves as a formal guarantee that what you've written works <cite>everton2020,flomo2018</cite>, and will be a quick way to verify that it continues to work when someone else makes changes <cite>flomo2018</cite>.
