It is important to write automated tests when working on a module or piece of code in the NUbots system<cite>fake,everton2020</cite>. Testing is not just an abstract "best practice" with no practical benefits, and it's not a waste of time <cite>everton2020</cite>. In fact, it'll actually save you and the other members of the team a lot of time going forward. The tests you write<cite>fake</cite> will serves as a formal guarantee that what you've written works<cite>everton2020,flomo2018</cite>, and will be a quick way to verify that it continues to work when someone else makes changes<cite>flomo2018</cite>.

Also this is a couple <cite>thuggerthugger999</cite> extra citation thingies <cite>hawking1988</cite> to test out.
