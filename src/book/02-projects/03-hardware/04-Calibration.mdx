Follow the instructions on the screen for all 4 positions
Test the calibration by setting the goal position to either side of the zero position (does the servo rotate all the way around)
Check that the servo positions is approximately the target postion at a few different points.
Check that the baud rate is still at (what the rate is)
Check that the servo ID is set correctly (link to list of servo IDs and positions)
