## Overview

A physics simulation implemented in [Matlab](https://au.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)/[Simulink](https://au.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html)/[SimscapeMultibody](https://au.mathworks.com/products/simmechanics.html). It's designed to have a higher accuracy than our previous simulations, which is more useful for AI training. Be careful as this project shares it's name with one of the major libraries it uses, Simscape.

## Simulations

### Static Simulation

This simulation will display physically-constrained, static poses of the robot, based on predefined joint positions.

### Contact Simulation

This simulation models contact forces and friction to a free-body robot.

### Servo Simulation

This simulation replaces the default Simscape Multibody revolute joints with Dynamixel MX64 and MX106 servo motors. This allows for the simulation-time modification of the robot pose for each servo.

## Usage

* For Matlab and Simulink you need an account and a license, The University of Newcastle has a campus license, see the [IT Services link](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/current-students/support/it/software-and-tools#table14022). 

* If you want to use SimscapeUDP, you need to run
    ```
    cd src/UDP
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../src/buildSimscapeUDP.sh
    ```

## SimscapeUDP

An extension to Simscape that allows the Servo Simulation to communicate with the NUbots NUClear code. SimscapeUDP sends and receives neutrons via UDP. It also adds the requirement for [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).
